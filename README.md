## Executive Summary
**LXP API** powers a modern Learning Experience Platform:
- Live classes (RTMP ingest → HLS delivery), VOD lessons, exams/QCM, and certifications.
- Clean separation of concerns (domain-driven modules) with **Role-Based Access Control** for `Admin`, `Tutor`, and `Learner`.
- Observability, rate limiting, DTO validation, and production-ready configuration out of the box.
